# **Wildcaards and Regular Expressions**

`Regular expressions` are patterns that can be used to match text. In Linux, they are 
used to allow a user to make rather generic expressions about what files they want a 
command to operate on.

Creating regular expressions to match filenmaes is known as `globbing`.

The regular expression patterns can be made using `special building blocks` known as
`wildcards`.

`Wildcards` are symbols with specific meanings to the shell.

## **Three Most Common Types:**

| Wildcard | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| **`*`**  | Matches anything, regardless of length. |
| **`?`**  | Matches anything, but for one place only. |
| **`[options]`**  | Matches any of the options inside for 1 place only. |
