# **File Archiving and Compression**

File archiving and compression is a `two-step` process in Linux.

First one creates a `tarball` to hold all the files that comprise the archive, and then
compresses that tarball using one of a variety of `compression` algorithms.

&nbsp;

## **The Overall Process**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **`1) Create a Tarball`**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First, you will create what is known as a tar file or "`tarball`". A tarball is a way of 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bundling together the files that you want to archive.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **`2) Compress the Tarball`**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Secondly, you will then compress the tarball with one of a variety of compression algorithms; 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;leaving you with a compressed archive.
