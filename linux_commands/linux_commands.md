# **Linux Commands**

<kbd>ctr + opt + t</kbd> ~ Opens Linux terminal

<kbd>ctr + opt + d</kbd> ~ Closes Linux terminal

<kbd>exit</kbd> ~ Closes Linux terminal

&nbsp;

<kbd>echo</kbd> ~ Echos as output what is typed as input in the terminal

<kbd>cal</kbd> ~ Gives a calendar of the current month and day (customizable).
*So you can give <kbd>cal</kbd> input and you can give it options*

&nbsp;

<kbd>date</kbd> ~ Gives the current date and time in full

<kbd>clear</kbd> ~ Cleans up the terminal workspace (`ctr + l`)

&nbsp;

Up ~ Cycles through commands previously written

<kbd>history</kbd> ~ Shows all the previous commands

<kbd>![line_num]</kbd> ~ Runs that particular command again

<kbd>!!</kbd> ~ Runs the most recent command ran

<kbd>history -c; history -w;</kbd> ~ Clears the history by writing the changes and
making them permanent 

&nbsp;

# **command_name options inputs**

command_name ~ Program Name

<kbd>echo `$`PATH</kbd> ~ Lets you see the Shell path

Shell Path ~ List of folders that contain these programs

<kbd>which [command_name]</kbd> ~ Tells which directory the command_name is stored in

&nbsp;

Some command_name's do require an input also known as an operand bc some commands
operate on the input

Options are presided by <kbd>-a</kbd>, <kbd>-b</kbd>, <kbd>-c</kbd>, <kbd>-d</kbd>
<kbd>-e</kbd>, <kbd>-f</kbd>, <kbd>-g</kbd> or you can chain the commands together
<kbd>-abcdefg</kbd>

Long form options are presided by <kbd>--two_dashes</kbd> and can not be chained. 
So, in long form it would be <kbd>--opt_1</kbd>, <kbd>--opt_2</kbd>, <kbd>--opt_3</kbd>

command_name and options are capital sensitive and need to be spelled exactly 

Sometimes options have their own inputs
