# **Searching the Cache**

Ubuntu's package manager (`apt`) uses the `/var/lib/apt/lists` as a `cache`. A cache is basically a place to store a local copy of some files in order to improve computational performance.

This cache (known as the `apt-cache`) contains lists of packages available in the Ubuntu repositories.

&nbsp;

The `Ubuntu Repositories` are:

| Name             | Description                                             |
|:---              |:---                                                     |
| **`Main`**       | `Free and Open Source` Software maintained by Canonical |
| **`Universe`**   | `Free and Open Source` Software maintained by the Ubuntu Community |
| **`Restricted`** | `Proprietary software` and drivers for company-specific devices such as wireless cards etc. |
| **`Multiverse`**  | Software that is `restricted either by copyright or legal issues`.
